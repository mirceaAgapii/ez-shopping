## Introduction
My company “EZ-shopping”, is developing a supermarket checkout application to help store owners to cope with the COVID situation by offering their customers the possibility to buy goods on their own without the help of cashiers and consultants.

## **Why EZ-Shopping?**
Regarding the pandemic situation from the last period, we always try to minimize contact with other people for our and their safety. But still, we can't avoid all possible places which are usually very crowded like public transport, stores, banks, etc. All these places are very important for us and we have to visit them even with the risk to be infected. 

But why not reduce the risk by decreasing the number of people we interact with? For example in a supermarket: imagine that we can just enter one, pick whatever we need and just leave without interacting with anyone? Isn't this brilliant? Especially for introverts :)

So now it is! Ok, not so revolutionary as it might sound at the first glance but it's a step forward towards a better world with fewer people bothering you with unnecessary things that you don't give a fu*k! 
Just joking :D  (No I'm not)

## With this application you'll be able to:
### For store customers:
* buy stuff from any market without waiting in endlessly queues;
* you don't need to scan every article anymore: just drop all the stuff you got in a special drawer and that's all, everything is already registered in the system;
* check the price of any article you want by scanning the barcode;
* prepare a check-list with necessary products;
* check the available stock of every product;

### For store owners:
* easily register new products in the system by scanning the article and applying an RF tag on each;
* reduce the costs for paying salary;
* increase the flow of customers;
* make your store more attractive for customers which care about their health;
